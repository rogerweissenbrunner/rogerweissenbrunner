### Disclaimer

I initiated the legal process of name change. Laws in my country establish that one can change its name for detriment, filiation, translation or prolonged use, the last one being the only one applicable to my case. Potential employers need to be aware, as I am still required to disclose my current identity and use it for document signing, academic validation and payment processing, among others.
